# KeyAuth-Python-Discord-Bot
Highly customizable discord bot build with the KeyAuth API, easy to build off of and made in Python. Primary use is generating keys, resetting their HWID and retrieving key info!

Pretty Sloppy Code, but should be easy enough to build off of.

## Built on KeyAuth API, see documentation https://keyauthdocs.apidog.io/

Mainly created for singular-use keys:

- Onetime keys when used last 24h
- Lifetime keys last forever.

Replace respective values, if left empty, then values won't be used.

Replace token at bottom of script; don't set it as a variable as it's exploitable.

Any questions, shoot me a message on discord: @srtdark
